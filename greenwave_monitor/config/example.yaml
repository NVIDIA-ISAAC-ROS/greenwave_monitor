# Example configuration for greenwave_monitor
# Defines topics to monitor with their expected frequencies and tolerances

greenwave_monitor:
  ros__parameters:
    # Controls which timestamp source is used for low-FPS error checks.
    # Valid values:
    # - header_with_nodetime_fallback (default): header timestamps when available, otherwise node
    #   time fallback for headerless topics.
    # - header_only: use only header/message timestamps (no fallback for headerless topics).
    # - nodetime_only: always use node/pub-time checks.
    gw_timestamp_monitor_mode: header_with_nodetime_fallback
    # gw_monitored_topics parameter specifies topics to monitor that do not require expected
    # frequencies or tolerances.
    gw_monitored_topics: ['/string_topic']
    # gw_frequency_monitored_topics parameter specifies the topics to monitor and their
    # expected frequencies and tolerances.
    gw_frequency_monitored_topics:
      /imu_topic:
        expected_frequency: 100.0
        tolerance: 10.0
      /image_topic:
        # If an invalid frequency is provided (e.g. 0.0), the topic will be monitored but no
        # expected frequency will be set.
        expected_frequency: 0.0
        # Invalid tolerance values are clamped to 0.0.
